* Bugs

  Please, use [[http://bugs.merproject.org/][Mer bugzilla]] (use component .Other) to submit bugs if
  you are planning to submit fix for it. Otherwise, if you just want
  to report an issue or propose a feature but you are not planning to
  change anything in the code yourself, use github "Issues" page.

* Commit message requirements

  Commit message should contain _anywhere_ in the body line in one of
  the following formats:

  ~[xxx] yyy. Fixes MER#ZZZ~

  ~[xxx] yyy. Contributes to MER#ZZZ~

  where

  - xxx :: some short tag (like [ui], [l10n], [rpm] etc.),

  - yyy :: short description of the change (longer description could
           be in the message body or, if line in this format is not
           the first one, first line could be more descriptive)

  - zzz :: MER bugzilla bug number.


  If you want to fix wording, you can refer to the MER#1305 bug, like:

  ~[l10n] Fixed some bla-bla wording. Contributes to MER#1305~
